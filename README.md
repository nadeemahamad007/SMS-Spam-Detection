# SMS-Spam-Detection

This project SMS Spam Detection involves building an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings and classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines, this project aims to accurately identify and filter out unwanted spam messages.

## Project Overview

The SMS Spam Detection project focuses on developing an AI model to classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. By leveraging advanced text processing and machine learning techniques, the project aims to create a robust spam filter capable of accurately identifying unwanted messages. The model uses feature extraction methods like TF-IDF and word embeddings, alongside classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Key Features

**1. Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning SMS text data, tokenization, and handling inconsistencies.
  
**2. Feature Extraction**:
  - **TF-IDF**: Converts text into numerical features reflecting word importance.
    
  - **Word Embeddings**: Provides dense vector representations of words, capturing semantic meanings.
    
  **3. Classification Models**:
  - **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem with feature independence assumptions.
    
  - **Logistic Regression**: Linear model predicting the probability of a message being spam.
    
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate spam from legitimate messages.
    
  **4. Model Evaluation**: Metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used

**1. Programming Language**: Python 3.x

**2. Libraries**:
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

  - **Numpy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.

  - **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## Conclusion

The SMS Spam Detection project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning techniques to address the problem of spam filtering in SMS messages. By employing various feature extraction methods and classification algorithms, the project aims to provide a reliable solution for distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages. Future improvements could involve incorporating more advanced models, optimizing feature extraction, and expanding the dataset for better performance.
